# Heart Disease Prediction

## Objective
Build a binary classification model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on medical features.

## Dataset
- UCI Heart Disease Dataset (from Kaggle)
- Features include age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.
- Target: 0 (No heart disease), 1 (At risk)

## Steps
1. Data cleaning and exploration
2. Train Logistic Regression
3. Evaluate using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
4. Visualize important features

## Results
- Accuracy: ~78%
- ROC-AUC: ~0.86
- Important features: sex,chest pain type,exercise included angina,oldpeak,vessels colored by flourosopy,thalassemia, slope,rest ecg,fasting blood sugar,Max heart rate,cholesterol,resting blood pressure,age

## Requirements
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
